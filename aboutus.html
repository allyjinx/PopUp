          <h2>WHO WE ARE</h2>
          <p>Missing In Action was created by two friends, one a wardrobe stylist, and the other a makeup artist. Both fed up with buying products online and being disappointed with fit, quality and the hassle of the return process. M.I.A takes the guess work out of your shopping experience while leaving the excitement.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <h2>MISSION M.I.A</h2>
          <p>Our mission is to allow women to shop the products they see and love online but are unsure of garment fit and quality. We will be introducing established brands currently unavailable in retail locations in Toronto that are both familiar to the online consumer as well as brands that aren’t as familiar that we are excited to share with you! </p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <h2>CURATION</h2>
          <p>Our pop-up shop offers Toronto a wide range of curated women’s apparel, accessories and beauty products for the modern woman. We understand that no one woman is the same and as such our products will provide both the fashion forward and modest woman with a substantial selection.</p>
